The Vis3r NxtVR headset is an open source, OpenXR and OpenHMD compliant, motion tracking VR headset that you can build yourself for under â‚¬80. It's designed to be printed on almost any home 3D printer, with simple and easy to assemble hardware components that are aimed at the complete novice. The headset comes in two distinct versions, both based around an STM32 development board along with a cheap and easily available screen and a headset that you can 3D print yourself. One uses the ever popular 6DoF MPU 6050, whilst the other uses the more recently released 9DoF BMX055 sensor board. As both the sensor boards and STM32 are very inexpensive, their combination offers one of the most cost effective and powerful hardware combinations available for a VR Headset. Full OpenXR and OpenHMD compliance means that the Vis3r Headset will plug straight into Steam, along with pretty much anything else that offers a VR interface.
